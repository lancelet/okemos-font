okemos-font
===========

Okemos is an open font, released under the SIL Open Font License.

It is an ultra-compressed, medium weight, sans serif font in the Swiss 
tradition.  It aims to provide an open, independently created ultra-compressed
typeface, which seem to be quite rare.  The look is also inspired by the 
StarTrek LCARS terminal font, but is intended to be somewhat more open and
readable.

Currently, the font has only upper-case Latin characters and minimal
punctuation.  There is also only minimal kerning information.  No
baseline or cap-height overshoot exists (C, G, J, O, Q and S will all require
overshoot), but my intention is to release variants with no, medium and
large overshoot.  Overshoot is a touchy issue for a font like this, which is
often used in all-caps and has a strong baseline.  I have been unhappy with the
baseline overshoot provided in commercial ultra-compressed sans-serif fonts.

The font is named after the region of Okemos, Michigan, near East Lansing.
